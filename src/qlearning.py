# Implement Q-learning algorithm 1 for solving the Gridworld (Section 4).
# We recommend implementing a Q(s, a) function as a simple 2-dimensional
# array, since there are only 46 states and 4 actions from each state. Initialize
# Q(s, a) values with 0 for all pairs (s, a). Set discount factor Î³ = 0.95.
# Choose the values of all other necessary parameters as you see fit, a little
# exploration of a parameters space can go a long way.
